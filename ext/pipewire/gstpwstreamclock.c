	 * is in the driver of the pipewire graph. That clock sets the pace of the graph. We do
	 * get periodic updates though; it is possible in the pw_stream process callback to
	 * call pw_stream_get_time_n(), which fills a pw_time struct with a snapshot that contains
	 * bits of timing information. In particular, it provides two timestamps: The monotonic
	 * system clock time when this snapshot was made, and the driver ticks, which essentially
	 * are like an "driver clock timestamp". We can interpret this as saying that at monotonic
	 * system clock time X the driver clock time was Y. This we refer to as an "observation".
	 * the monotonic system clock time is stored in the "now" field of the pw_time struct; the
	 * driver clock time is indirectly present as "ticks" in that same struct (it can be translated
	 * to a timestamp with the "rate" field of the pw_time struct).
	 *
	 * Using this information, we can reconstruct the driver clock in a piecewise linear fashion.
	 * In between observations, we extrapolate an driver clock timestamp based on the timestamps
	 * from the current and the last observations. The differences between their timestamps are
	 * used as the clock rate:
	 *
	 *   driver_clock_rate = (driver_clock_time - previous_driver_clock_time) / (system_clock_time - previous_driver_clock_time)
	 *
	 * With this, get_internal_time_unlocked() can then extrapolate:
	 *
	 *   extrapolated_driver_clock_timestamp = (current_sysclock_time - system_clock_time_offset) * driver_clock_rate + driver_clock_time_offset
	 *
	 * The offsets exist to translate the extrapolated timestamps to fit into the "pieces" that
	 * make up the piecewise linear extrapolation. driver_clock_time_offset and system_clock_time_offset
	 * applied such that the extrapolated timestamps begin at driver_clock_time_offset. In other words,
	 * if the current system clock time is the same as system_clock_time, we want the extrapolated
	 * result to be equal to driver_clock_time_offset.
	 *
	 * In addition, we have to take into account the situations when no extrapolation is possible.
	 * These are:
	 *
	 * 1. When freeze() was called. Callers do this when they for example reconfigure the pw_stream.
	 * 2. When the pwstreamclock is initially used. There is no "previous observation" present then;
	 *    no extrapolation can be made. We can interpret this as the clock being initially frozen.
	 *
	 * (A reset() call implies that the clock gets frozen.)
	 *
	 * In both cases, extrapolation will only be possible after a new observation has been made.
	 * Until then, a form of clock stretching is used by get_internal_time_unlocked() instead -
	 * it just returns the value of last_timestamp. Once a new observations is made, the
	 * clock is "unfrozen", that is, extrapolations are possible (again). We do not want to
	 * cause sudden big jumps in the timestamps though - instead, they shall continue at the
	 * timestamp value from before it was frozen (that is, getting a timestamp immediately
	 * after unfreezing should return the value of last_timestamp). For this purpose, the
	 * base_driver_clock_time_offset exists. It is updated only if extrapolation hadn't been
	 * possible so far and just became possible due to now having a new observation. Its
	 * function is to additionally shift driver_clock_time_offset to cover the timespan
	 * during which the clock was "frozen". That way, discontinuities are avoided.
	 *
	 * Note that while computing the driver clock rate requires *two* observations, for unfreezing,
	 * we start/resume extrapolation after just *one* observation. In case #1 above (= the freeze()
	 * function was called), we just reuse the last driver clock rate that was in effect before
	 * the clock was frozen. In case #2 above (= initial state), the rate is set to 1 (see reset()).
